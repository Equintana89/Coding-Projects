		<h2><a name="The beginning of the journey"></a>How it all began</h2>
		<p>The most excitement I have ever felt was when trying to impress a beautiful young lady. Here are a few short stories of our timeline from when we first met up until now.</p>
		<h2>Meeting for the first time</h2>
		<p>In ancient Greece, runners competed in a relay race called a lampadedromia.1 In the race, runners held a torch in their hand and passed it on to the next runner until the final member of the team crossed the finish line.
		The prize wasn’t awarded to the team that ran fastest—it was awarded to the first team to reach the finish line with its torch still lit.
		There is a profound lesson here, one taught by prophets ancient and modern: while it is important to start the race, it is even more important that we finish with our torch still lit.
		The great King Solomon is an example of someone who started strong. When he was young, he “loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of David his father” (1 Kings 3:3). God was pleased with him and said, “Ask what I shall give thee” (1 Kings 3:5).
		Instead of asking for riches or a long life, Solomon asked for “an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad” (1 Kings 3:9).</p>

		<h2>Dancing in the clouds</h2>
		<p>Instead of asking for riches or a long life, Solomon asked for “an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad” (1 Kings 3:9).
		One of the best ways to keep your spiritual torch burning brightly is to make sure you’re having meaningful spiritual experiences. But that is easier said than done, so here is a suggestion to 
		help you continue to spiritually progress: Think of a gospel-related activity you’ve never done before (or hardly ever do) and commit to doing it every day for a month. You can start small because you’ll find that it’s easier to turn small changes into lasting ones. 
		Doing things that take us out of our spiritual comfort zone might require more faith and effort on our part, but when we do them, we are inviting the Holy Ghost to be with us, and we are showing greater faith in Heavenly Father and a desire to draw nearer to Him. 
		Here are a few ideas to get you started:</p>

		<h2><a name="Second date"></a>The Second Date: Toby Love and Xtreme</h2>
		<p>A long time ago in Greece, there was a race where the runners held lit torches. Whoever ran the whole race with the torch still lit was the winner. President Uchtdorf says life is like that race. The torch we hold is the Light of Christ. When we try to be 
		like Jesus Christ, we make our torches burn brighter.The Guide to the Scriptures defines charity as “the highest, noblest, strongest kind of love” (“Charity”). It is the pure love of Jesus Christ. As we learn of Jesus Christ and strive to become like Him, we will begin 
		to feel His pure love in our lives and be prompted to love and serve others as He would. “Charity is having patience with someone who has let us down,” said President Thomas S. Monson. “It is resisting the impulse to become offended easily. It is accepting weaknesses and shortcomings. 
		It is accepting people as they truly are. It is looking beyond physical appearances to attributes that will not dim through time. It is resisting the impulse to categorize others.</p>

		<h2><a name="Mob"></a>Meeting the Mob</h2>
		<p>I talked with my bishop and expressed my concerns. I explained how I just couldn’t reach all of the sisters I wanted to. I described how I wished that I had five of me to get the job done the way I thought it should be. I tried to keep my concerns light and humorous, but my eyes quickly 
		filled with tears of discouragement. He smiled and offered some of the best leadership advice I have ever received.This experience prompted me to think about the choices we make, particularly in our relationships with others. Whether with our family, our friends, our employer, or those we date or marry, 
		when a choice is between two good things, recognizing the right or best option is sometimes difficult, especially when we want to avoid making wrong choices. Fear of making the wrong choice sometimes paralyzes us, and that fear can inhibit us from moving forward in faith. But the truth is, sometimes there 
		isn’t a wrong choice. There’s just a choice. In my father’s case, he based his decision on what he valued more. He hated to see the pumpkins die, but he knew he would regret the damage they would do to the melons later.</p>
