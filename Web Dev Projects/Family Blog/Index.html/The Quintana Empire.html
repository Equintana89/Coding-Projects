		<h3>A little bit about us<h3/>
		<p><font size="3">My family consists of myself, Eduardo "AKA" Eddie my wife Abish my daughter Lilian Alessandra who is currently 2 yrs 8 months old and our baby boy Isai Eduardo.
		Not that big of a family...yet. My wife and I are originally from Chihuahua, Mexico. My parents brought me to Utah when i was 2 yrs old. My wife came to Utah when
		she was about 14 yrs old. I can't imagine how she survived the drastic culture change not knowing english while going to school here. However, I am very grateful 
		for her effort and diligence of not giving up. That made it possible for me to meet her later on in my life. My daughter Lily is one of a kind. She is sweet, gentle,
		very intelligent and loving. She is also very.. i mean VERY determined when it comes to things she desires to have or do. We know that phase as the terrible two's.
		Even though they describe it as "terrible", I always enjoy and cherish when i have the blessing to play and pretend with her when she welcomes into her world of make
		believe where anyting is possible. My baby boy, Isai, is growing really fast. He just turned 5 months. He is such a peacemaker. You see him and any negative feelings
		you may have just melts away with the love he shares by only making eye contact with him and then watching that smile come out little by little. Isai is a very strong
		baby. I want to say that he will be walking a lot faster than we think. A few other pieces of information i would like to share is that were are not a perfect family...
		in fact we are far from perfect. We are LDS and love the lifestyle and blessings we recieve from living according to our Saviors teaching. We enjoy enjoy watching sports
		...well mainly me especially when bascketball season has started. We love being outdoors contemplating the creationg of God. This a little bit about us just to start. 
		If want to know more about our history please click on any of the links below. Please note that the links are in chronological order. Hope you feel our love and enjoy
		getting to know my own prize and possession; my family empire.
		</p>
